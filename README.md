# STM32F103C8T6
This is my journey into teaching myself how to program the STM32F1 without using ST's SPL or HAL library ("bare metal") to gain a better understanding. I use the cheap "STM32F103C8T6 dev boards" which can be easily found online for <5â‚¬. 
There is a simple example for each peripheral, so far including:
* Timers
* ADC
* DMA
* I2C
* USART
